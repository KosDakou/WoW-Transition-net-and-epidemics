# WoW - Transition net and epidemics



    The dataset used comes from the paper "World of Warcraft Avatar History Dataset" by Yeng-Ting Lee, Kuan-Ta Chen, Yun-Maw Cheng, and Chin-Laung Lei (https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~swc/pub/world_of_warcraft_avatar_history.html) where it explains how it was created and the files it contains. It can be found on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/warcraft-avatar-history).
    
    My idea was to use this dataset in order to create a graph and analyse it by applying the theory I studied in the Network Science book by Albert-László Barabási (https://barabasi.com/book/network-science).
